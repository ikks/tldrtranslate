# tldrtranshelper

This is a helper to translate tldr pages, it's aimed to spanish but can
be modified to make use of other languages.

For now requires an argostranslate API to make automatic translation that
needs to be supervised and edited by a human.

## Requirements

* You need zig 0.13.0 to run this helper
* API argos-translate instance running


Feel free to clone and modify to suit your needs.
